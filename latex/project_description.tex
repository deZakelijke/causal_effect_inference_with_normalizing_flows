\noindent
The goal of this project is to see if it is possible to extent the work of Louizos et al. \cite{louizos2017causal} through the use of Normalising Flows. Louizos et al. have shown that variational inference can be used for causal inference. We now want to discover if we can improve of their VAE-based \cite{kingma2013auto} method with Normalising Flows \cite{rezende2016variational}\cite{berg2018sylvester}\cite{dinh2016density}. It has been shown that these models are capable of capturing more diverse and complex posterior distributions, which is needed in this research.

The first phase of the project will focus on the literature research on causal inference and normalising flows, and on reproducing earlier results. In the second phase we will gradually transform the CEVAE into a more powerful NF-based model.
